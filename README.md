    <h1>AIT Club Page</h1>
    <p>
        The sole purpose of this website was to win an event (and so we did😌). No, not really! AIT being such a happenign college it was very important to track down what events are happening and when.
        This website contains many sections containign all relevant data like:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Club events with timeline🤔:</b> so that you know what event is taking place and when.</li>
            <li><b>Classes by clubs🤓:</b>Not leaving the nerdy ones behind... ait clubs provide relevant classes related to their fields of expertise.</li>
            <li><b>Club Members👪:</b> You have access to the clubs social media or club websites wherever possible so that you can have direct access to the people in charge.</li>
        </ul>
